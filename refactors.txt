General:
I have a mix of strings and dates. Everything needs to use dates.

Room:
self.create_all could use map.
available_rooms_by_date could use the filter method.
self.reserved_rooms_by_date could use the filter method.

Reservation:
The cost could be a variable so it could be modified.

Front desk:
It has a lot of responsabilities.
- available_block_rooms could be in the Hotel_block class.
- create_a_block could be in the Hotel_block class.
available_block_rooms could use the filter method.
